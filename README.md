This is a turn-based RPG game featuring a StarWars theme.

Players will select a character by clicking any of the four StarWars characters at the top of the screen.

Once a player has  selected a character, the enemies panel will populate below the character/defender windows.

Selecting an enemy will trigger the battle sequence. Press attack to attack the defender, who will then counter attack your character. Continue this sequence until all enemies are defeated.
